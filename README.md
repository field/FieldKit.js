Basic building blocks for computational design projects. 
Written in CoffeeScript for browser and server environments.


Note
====

This is my latest attempt at combining useful computational design tools with core packages like Math, Colour and Physics 
into one cohesive library. I gave up on earlier projects either due to a lack of time or because the implementation language
had to change and so on.

As our projects start to converge more and more towards using web tools, 
also in browser-less e.g. installation and generative projects, it seemed like a good idea to give this bundeling attempt another go.

Because of all this, please bear in mind that the codebase will change a lot for the next couple versions!
